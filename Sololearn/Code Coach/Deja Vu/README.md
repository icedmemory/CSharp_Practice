<h1>Deja Vu</h1>
You aren't paying attention and you accidentally type a bunch of random letters on your keyboard. You want to know if you ever typed the same letter twice, or if they are all unique letters.

<h2>Task</h2>
If you are given a string of random letters, your task is to evaluate whether any letter is repeated in the string or if you only hit unique keys while you typing.
<h3>Input Format</h3>
A string of random letter characters (no numbers or other buttons were pressed).
<h3>Output Format</h3>
A string that says 'Deja Vu' if any letter is repeated in the input string, or a string that says 'Unique' if there are no repeats.
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
aaaaaaaghhhhjkll
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
Deja Vu
<h3>Explanation</h3>
Your program should output 'Deja Vu' because there are many repetitions in 'aaaaaaaghhhhjkll'.
