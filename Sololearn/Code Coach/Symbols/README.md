<h1>Symbols</h1>
There is a problem with your keyboard: it randomly writes symbols when you are typing a text. You need to clean up the text by removing all symbols.

<h2>Task</h2>
Take a text that includes some random symbols and translate it into a text that has none of them. The resulting text should only include letters and numbers.
<h3>Input Format</h3>
A string with random symbols.
<h3>Output Format</h3>
A string of the text with all the symbols removed.
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
#l$e%ts go @an#d@@ g***et #l#unch$$$
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
lets go and get lunch
<h3>Explanation</h3>
If you take out every symbol and leave only the letters and numbers, your text says 'lets go and get lunch'.
