<h1>Isogram Detector</h1>
An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, whether they are consecutive or non-consecutive. Your job is to find a way to detect if a word is an isogram.

<h2>Task</h2>
Write a program that takes in a string as input, detects if the string is an isogram and outputs true or false based on the result.
<h3>Input Format</h3>
A string containing one word.
<h3>Output Format</h3>
A string: true or false.
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
turbulence
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
false
<h3>Explanation</h3>
The word turbulence has multiple "u" and "e" in it, which would mean it is not an isogram.
