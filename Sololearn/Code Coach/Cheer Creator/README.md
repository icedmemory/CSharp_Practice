<h1>Cheer Creator</h1>
You are cheering on your favorite team. After each play, if your team got over 10 yards further down the field, you stand up and give your friend a high five. If they don't move forward by at least a yard you stay quiet and say 'shh', and if they move forward 10 yards or less, you say 'Ra!' for every yard that they moved forward in that play.
