<h1>The Spy Life</h1>
You are a secret agent, and you receive an encrypted message that needs to be decoded. The code that is being used flips the message backwards and inserts non-alphabetic characters in the message to make it hard to decipher.

<h2>Task</h2> 
Create a program that will take the encoded message, flip it around, remove any characters that are not a letter or a space, and output the hidden message.
<h3>Input format</h3>
A string of characters that represent the encoded message.
<h3>Output format</h3> 
A string of character that represent the intended secret message.
<h3>Sample input</h3>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
