<h1>Camel to Snake</h1>
The company you are working for is refactoring its entire codebase. It's changing all naming conventions from camel to snake case (camelCasing to snake_casing). Every capital letter is replaced with its lowercase prefixed by an underscore _, except for the first letter, which is lowercased without the underscore, so that SomeName becomes some_name.

<h2>Task</h2>
Write a program that takes in a string that has camel casing, and outputs the same string but with snake casing.
<h3>Input Format</h3>
A string with camelCasing.
<h3>Output Format</h3>
The same string but with snake_casing.
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
camelCasing
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
camel_casing
<h3>Explanation</h3>
The capital C was lowercased and prefixed by an underscore.
